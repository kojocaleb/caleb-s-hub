In this prohect, I worked on a Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario, playing the role of both pentester and SOC analyst.

Red Team: Attack a vulnerable VM within an environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine.

Blue Team: Use Kibana to review logs of the Red Team activities to extract hard data and visulizations, report all suspicious activities and suggest mitigation reasons for exploits found.
